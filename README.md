# input_validation_security
Assignment was to detect vulnerabilities on input validation and to mitigate.  The following were found and mitigated: IDS50-J. Use Conservative file naming conventions, FIO16-J. Canonicalize path names before validating them, IDS08-J. Sanitize untrusted data included in a regular expression, IDS51-J. Properly encode or escape output, IDS01-J. Normalize strings before validating them, ERR01-J. Do not allow exceptions to expose sensitive information.  WHITELISTED_PATH should be changed to whatever path the user is accessing during running for EmailAddresses.txt.
